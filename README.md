It provides features for routing, handling requests, managing databases, and more.</li> <li>SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained relational database management system. It is the default database used by Django for local development.</li> <li>HTML/CSS: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are fundamental technologies for creating the structure and styling of web pages.</li> <li>JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language used for adding interactivity and functionality to web pages. In this project, JavaScript is likely used for frontend interactions and validation.</li></ul>
